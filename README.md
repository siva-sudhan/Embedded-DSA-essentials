# Embedded DSA Essentials

A curated collection of embedded-friendly data structure and algorithm problems written in C, optimized for real-world memory and performance constraints.

### ðŸ“Œ Focus Areas:
- Low-level memory-safe implementations
- In-place algorithms
- Bit manipulation
- Embedded system constraints (e.g., no malloc)
- Optimized for microcontrollers

### ðŸš€ Usage:
- `problems/` â€“ C files for problem statements
- `solutions/` â€“ Codex-assisted or hand-written solutions
- `notes/` â€“ Embedded-specific insights (cache, memory, timing)

---

### âœ¨ Codex Integration

Whenever Iâ€™m stuck on a problem, I document it and generate `.c` solutions using OpenAI Codex (via ChatGPT or CLI). These are tagged accordingly.
