Compact Sensor Event Tracker Notes
=================================

- Events are stored using two bits, allowing four logical values (0â€“3).
- `insert_event` and `get_event` compute the target byte using `index >> 2`
  and place the event at `(3 - (index & 3)) * 2` bits within that byte.
- The 16-event extension uses four bits per event, storing two events per
  byte with a similar shift calculation based on `index >> 1`.
- Wear-leveling is simulated with per-byte modification counters. When a
  counter exceeds `MAX_MODIFICATIONS` (10), a callback is invoked and the
  counter resets, allowing the caller to relocate data and reduce flash wear.
