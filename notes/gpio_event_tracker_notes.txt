GPIO Event Tracker Notes
=======================

- A static array `uint32_t pins[8]` stores the state of 256 GPIO pins.
  Each element represents 32 pins, giving a total of 32 bytes of storage.
- Bit indexing:
  - `pins[pin_id / 32]` selects the 32-bit word for a pin.
  - `(pin_id % 32)` selects the bit within that word.

Functions
---------
- `set_pin_active` and `set_pin_inactive` toggle the appropriate bit.
- `is_pin_active` tests the bit and returns a boolean.
- `count_active_pins` sums `__builtin_popcount` of each word.
- `get_first_active_pin` (optional) finds the first non-zero word and uses
  `__builtin_ctz` to locate the lowest set bit, avoiding a full 256-bit scan.

This implementation meets the 32â€‘byte memory limit and requires no dynamic
allocation.
