Packed GPIO Pin Configuration Table Notes
=========================================

Each pin's mode is stored in two bits of a 64-bit register. To modify
one pin:

1. Create a mask `0x3ULL << (2 * pin)` covering its two bits.
2. Clear those bits in the register using `&= ~mask`.
3. OR the desired configuration (masked to 0x3) shifted into place.

Reading a pin simply involves shifting right by `2 * pin` and masking
with `0x3`.

This design avoids additional memory and mirrors how microcontrollers
pack configuration bits for GPIO pins.
