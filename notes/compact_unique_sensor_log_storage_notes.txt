Compact Unique Sensor Log Storage Notes
======================================

This approach uses a single 64-bit variable as a bitmap. Each bit
position corresponds to a reading in the range 0â€“63.

- **store_sensor_readings** iterates through the provided array and sets
the bit for each reading. Because each bit can only be 0 or 1, this
automatically removes duplicates and keeps the values logically sorted
by index.
- **print_logged_readings** scans from bit 0 to bit 63, printing any index
with its bit set. This order guarantees ascending output without needing
additional data structures.

This implementation avoids dynamic memory entirely and uses only a
single 64-bit variable for storage, making it suitable for memory-
constrained embedded systems.
