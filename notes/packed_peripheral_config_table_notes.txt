Packed Peripheral Config Table Notes
===================================

The configuration table packs 16 peripherals using three bits each for a
total of 48 bits. Because the array spans only six bytes, updating a
single peripheral may require modifying bits across two adjacent bytes.

The solution builds a 64-bit temporary variable from the array, updates
the relevant 3-bit field, then writes the bytes back. This approach keeps
the bit manipulations simple and avoids undefined behavior from shifting
more than the width of a byte.
