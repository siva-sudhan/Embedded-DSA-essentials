Memory-Constrained Logger System Notes
=====================================

The logger uses a static 1 KB memory pool to hold both log strings and
metadata. Each log entry is stored exactly once in the pool and indexed
by a 16-bit offset. Duplicates are detected through a linear search of
previous entries.

Retrieving logs in alphabetical order involves copying existing strings
into a new array, sorting them with `qsort`, and returning the array to
the caller. This keeps the persistent memory footprint below the 1 KB
limit while allowing sorted retrieval on demand.
