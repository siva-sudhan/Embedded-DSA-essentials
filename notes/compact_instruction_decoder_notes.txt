Compact Instruction Decoder Notes
================================

The decoder uses a fixed-size `uint16_t opcode_freq[256]` array to count
how often each opcode appears. For each 16-bit instruction we shift right
by eight bits to isolate the opcode and increment its counter. Because at
most 1000 instructions are processed, 16-bit counters are sufficient and
no dynamic memory is required.

After counting, we scan the array to find the opcode with the highest
frequency. The function returns both the opcode and its count in an
`OpcodeStat` structure. This approach keeps memory usage predictable and
works well on microcontrollers without malloc.
