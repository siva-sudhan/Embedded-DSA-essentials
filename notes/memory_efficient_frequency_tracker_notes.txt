Memory-Efficient Frequency Tracker Notes
=======================================

The frequency table stores two 4-bit counters per byte to track the
occurrence count of all 256 possible sensor values.

- **Byte layout**: index `i` corresponds to byte `i/2`.
  - If `i` is even, its count occupies the lower 4 bits.
  - If `i` is odd, the count is in the upper 4 bits.

- **Incrementing**: read the existing 4-bit value, clamp it to a maximum
  of 15, then store it back by masking and shifting. This avoids
  exceeding the 4-bit limit.

- **Helper** `get_frequency` simply extracts the proper nibble and
  returns it, aiding code readability.

This compact representation requires only 128 bytes, well under the
512-byte limit, while still supporting up to 15 occurrences per value.
